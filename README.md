* Add a fully functioning physics simulation loader menu background
- This includes the following simulations:
- An elasticity & friction simulator
- A rocket launching simulator
- Pendulum simulator
- Orbiting planets
- Basic projectile motion
- Spring-mass System
- Fluids?? (TBD)
- Simple Harmonic Motion? (TBD)
- 3D features? (TBD)

* Add fully adjustable text input and sliders/values for each of these
- A list of the variables that need to be changed to change the simulation will be shown w/ sliders

* Add a debug mode button/menu option that turns on a bunch of print statements (a boolean true/false)

* Implement multithreading capabilities to speed up the simulation (optimization feature) --> future update v2.0 maybe

* Implement a system where the user can save config files (if they change mass for example, it would ask them to save their work before
exiting, and it would be saved in a .txt file or something like that, and it would read as follows)

-> simulation1="rocket"
-> mass="3.5kg"
-> ...
-> simulation2="pendulum"
-> ...
...

** only use this system if the user actually changes values in the sliders

* Add a dark mode?
